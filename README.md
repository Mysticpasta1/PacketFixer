The mod is not really in beta, betas are to differentiate fabric (betas) from forge (releases).

## Description
This mod fixes various package erros. This mod could be used in mod packs for increasing the number of mods.

### Fix these problems:
 - Tried to read NBT tag that was too big; tried to allocate: X bytes where max allowed: 2097152
 - Badly compressed packet - size of X is larger than protocol maximum of 2097152
 - Packet too big (is X, should be less than 8388608)
 - Payload may not be larger than 1048576 bytes
 - Payload may not be larger than 32767 bytes
